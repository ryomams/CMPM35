### FloomieTap
<p> Made in collaboration with my friend, Nishant Suria, FloomieTap is a soundboard inspired by https://patatap.com/ and https://aidn.jp/mikutap/ made using the P5.js library. It uses samples from various youtube videos we like, acompanied with a looping soundtrack made in Logic Pro.</p>

### FloomieBloomie
<p> Typically, mood tracking apps use traditional charts (ie. bar graphs, line graphs) to visualize how one's mood might fluctuate over time. Unfortunately, the use of number-oriented graphs inherently imply a new high or low score to be reached with one's mood. Made in collaboration with Nishant Suria, FloomieBloomie provides a unique visualization of your day.</p>
