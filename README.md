### FloomieTap
Made in collaboration with my friend, Nishant Suria, FloomieTap is a soundboard inspired by <https://patatap.com/> and <https://aidn.jp/mikutap/> made using the P5.js library. It uses samples from various youtube videos we like, acompanied with a looping soundtrack made in Logic Pro.

- [Live Demo](https://ryomams.github.io/CMPM35/FloomieTap/index.html)

### FloomieBloomie
<p> Typically, mood tracking apps use traditional charts (ie. bar graphs, line graphs) to visualize how one's mood might fluctuate over time. Unfortunately, the use of number-oriented graphs inherently imply a new high or low score to be reached with one's mood. Made in collaboration with Nishant Suria, FloomieBloomie provides a unique visualization of your day using D3.js.</p>

### FloomieSpoopie
<p> A small platformer made using Three.js in collaboration with Nishant Suria. You can wall climb! (Which was originally a bug but we turned it into a feature...) It was designed to be a new installment in the <a href="https://itch.io/c/1305039/this-game-is-not">This Game is Not</a> series.</p>
