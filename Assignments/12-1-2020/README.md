I modified [3_lights.html](https://ryoma.ms/CMPM35/Assignments/12-1-2020/3_lights.html) to:
- take up the full screen
- add an extra seafoam green (#00FA92) light at (0, -10, 0)
- replace all the original shapes, save for the (0, 2, 0) torus with:
    - 3 torus knots
    - 1 duplicate of the original torus
- add two extra toruses, both duplicates of the original torus provided.
