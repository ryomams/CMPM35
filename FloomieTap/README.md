FloomieTap
---
Made in collaboration with my friend, Nishant Suria, FloomieTap is a soundboard inspired by https://patatap.com/ and https://aidn.jp/mikutap/ made using the P5.js library. It uses samples from various youtube videos we like, acompanied with a looping soundtrack made in Logic Pro.

In order to run this loclly, you must start an HTTP server to connect to.
More details on this can be found at:

If you're interested at looking at our code, the bulk of it can be found in *sketch.js*.
The rest is mostly P5 stuff.
